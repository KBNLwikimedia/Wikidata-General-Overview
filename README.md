# Wikidata general overview
*General overview of the Wikidata universe to make newcomers more familiar and self-reliant in this (sometimes) confusing ecosystem. Collected and curated by KB, national library of the Netherlands.*

This page was originally extracted from the slides of the lecture *Introduction Wikibase, the basics*, for employeees of [KB, national library of the Netherlands](https://www.kb.nl) on 7 September 2023. This (rather long) slidedeck is available on [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Introductiecursus_Wikibase_-_Koninklijke_Bibliotheek,_7_september_2023.pdf) and [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8338811).

This overview is heavily inspired by the *[Wikibase knowledge graphs, A collection of open source tools and resources related to Wikibase knowledge graphs](https://github.com/shigapov/wikibase-knowledge-graphs)* by Renat Shigapov. I've used his centralized overview many times to improve my understanding of the Wikibase universe, and hope to extend it via the overview below, and help others in a similar way.

**Motivation**

I created this page for several reasons:

* As a *textual summary* of my (rather exuberant, visual) [presentation](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8338811) of September 7th.
* From my own experience (especially if you are new to Wikibase) I know that it can be very time-consuming to discover and understand the different corners of the Wikibase world, and to find your way in this rather confusing forrest/jungle. I hope this *centralized knowledge hub* can help others make that journey a little easier/faster.
* I have only been able to acquire most of my Wikibase knowledge thanks to the openness and generosity of the international Wikibase community and their willingness to make knowledge findable, visible and reusable for free. So I think it is no more than 'good reciprocal decency' to *contribute to the community* this overview of centralized and summarized knowledge.
* As a place to record my *"public personal memory of interesting Wikibase stuff"*.
